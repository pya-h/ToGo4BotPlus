# Other Notes:
*   ... means that these cammands can also be used after previous command in the same line.
*   Each line can contain multiple command, as many as you want. Like:

=>   +   new_togo    @   1   10:00   +p  85  #  +   next_togo   +x  #   %

*   Extra:
=>        +x: its an extra Togo. its not mandatory but has extra points doing it.
=>        -x: not extra (default)
*   all params between [] are optional.


# Remember:
*   The flag list separator is 2 SPACES. space character will be evaluated as a part of the current flag's param. do not be mistaken.
*   in 'add new togo' syntax, all flags are optional except for the title, meaning that you can simply add new togos even with specifying the title only such as:
=>  +   new togo here
*   use -a flag for % and # commands to expand the togos range to ALL Times.

# P.S.:
   Street/Service Project, means that this one is coded while walking streets or while doing service!
